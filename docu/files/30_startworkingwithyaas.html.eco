title: 'How Do I Start Working with YaaS?'
---

<p>By now, you have&nbsp;already seen some of the main YaaS building blocks, for example the&nbsp;<a href="https://market.yaas.io/standard">YaaS Market</a>.</p>
<p>YaaS Market is an online marketplace where you subscribe to packages.</p>
<p>Also, you have seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://builder.yaas.io/login/login.html">Builder</a>. &nbsp;The Builder is an orchestration and publishing component. It&acute;s where you manage your organization, projects, packages and perform different daily tasks such as managing products. So, what else is there?</p>
<p>There is the DevPortal - an information and knowledge hub for developers. In it, developers&nbsp;can read documentation and access free online trainings to learn about YaaS and available services. Additionally, all necessary technical information about microservices and packages is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/">DevPortal</a>.</p>
<p>There&nbsp;is also the&nbsp;<a href="https://knowledge.yaas.io/">Knowledge Hub</a>&nbsp;- the information and learning hub for non-technical people. It contains various guides, articles and free online training.</p>
<p>If you want to receive updates on new package releases, YaaS teams publish release notes for each new version of every package. You can find the list <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/rn/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help, YaaS uses the established&nbsp;<a href="https://experts.hybris.com/spaces/151/index.html">Hybris Experts</a>. You can simply submit your question and one or more of our experts or maybe even your peers will answer it. Hybris Experts is part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://community.yaas.io/">YaaS Community</a>. Both are open to everyone. You can read questions and answers on Hybris Experts without registration, but if you want to write a question you will have to register.</p>
<p>Finally if you want to stay tuned and build your network, SAP Hybris experts are taking part in many conferences and meet-ups throughout the year.&nbsp;You can find the list&nbsp;<a href="https://events.yaas.io/">here</a>.</p>
